# Design Principles

## 1. Seamless Integration
- Native integration with Figma and existing workflows
- Minimal context switching between Figma and web application
- Consistent experience across platforms
- Single source of truth for event tracking definitions

## 2. Clear Visual Hierarchy
- Status indicators should be immediately recognizable
- Implementation progress should be visible at a glance
- Clear distinction between different types of events
- Visual cues for data relationships and dependencies

## 3. Progressive Disclosure
- Show the most relevant information first
- Complex features accessible through intuitive progressive steps
- Advanced options available but not overwhelming
- Guided workflows for new users

## 4. Collaborative First
- Real-time updates and synchronization
- Clear ownership and change history
- Contextual comments and discussions
- Easy sharing and export capabilities

## 5. Data Quality by Design
- Standardized event naming conventions
- Built-in data schema validation
- Clear documentation templates
- Version control for event definitions

## 6. Accessibility and Inclusivity
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color-blind friendly status indicators

## 7. Performance and Reliability
- Minimal impact on Figma performance
- Offline capability for critical features
- Efficient data synchronization
- Responsive interface across devices

## 8. Error Prevention
- Clear validation feedback
- Prevent duplicate event definitions
- Warning for breaking changes
- Auto-save and recovery features

## 9. Extensibility
- API-first approach for integrations
- Customizable workflows
- Pluggable architecture
- Support for custom data schemas

## 10. Security and Privacy
- Role-based access control
- Audit trails for sensitive operations
- Secure data transmission
- Privacy by design
